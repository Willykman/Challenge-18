# Challenge-18
**Pychain Challenge #18**
**Objective**
You’re a fintech engineer who’s working at one of the five largest banks in the world. You were recently promoted to act as the lead developer on their decentralized finance team. Your task is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface. This ledger should allow partner banks to conduct financial transactions (that is, to transfer money between senders and receivers) and to verify the integrity of the data in the ledger.

**Technologies**
This project leverages Python 3.7 with the following packages:

web3 - For interacting with Ethereum
streamlit - To turn data scripts into shareable web apps

**Contributors**
Starter code for this app was provided by the CU Fintech Bootcamp. Updates to that code to fulfill the analysis were done by William Korman and help from TA.
